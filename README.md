1. **Start:** Click the "Start" button to initiate the stopwatch, and the elapsed time begins counting.

2. **Stop:** Click the "Stop" button to pause the stopwatch. The displayed time freezes at the paused moment.

3. **Reset:** Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch. If the stopwatch is running, it resets the displayed time to zero while keeping the count running.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The stopwatch provides a clear and easy-to-read display of elapsed time.

- **Start, Stop, Reset:** Standard stopwatch functionalities are implemented with buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting.

- **Continuation from Stop:** The stopwatch continues counting from where it was stopped when the "Start" button is clicked after a pause.

import React from 'react';
import Stopwatch from './path/to/Stopwatch';

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Stopwatch Example</h1>

    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
